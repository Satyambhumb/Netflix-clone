## Features

- **Interactive FAQ Section:** The "Frequently Asked Questions" section uses JavaScript to toggle the visibility of answers when a question is clicked.
- **Modern UI:** The design incorporates a clean, modern aesthetic with a dark theme, a radial gradient curve, and a hover effect on cards.
